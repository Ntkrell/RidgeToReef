    "Rainfall in many dryland ecosystems exhibits pronounced variability from year to year. In this excercise, we will investigate the nature of rainfall at some locations in Kenya and Zambia and use these data to draw inference into the nature of the rainfall process. Finally, we will use the data to develop an empirical model of rainfall that we could use to simulate the rainfall process across many realizations of discrete growing seasons. \n",
