    "This courses uses [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebooks. These notebooks are a web application in which you can create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations as well as text. The ability to include both code and text elements makes these documents ideal for conducting data analysis and describing results. Notebooks can be run, revised, and re-run - an iterative process that allows for exploratory data analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks can run code from a variety of languages, and the name \"Jupyter\" is a loose acronym made up of Julia, Python, and R. While these were the first programming languages Jupyter coudl use, the notebook technology now supports [many other languages](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels). The two most commonly used in Earth and Environmental Sciences are [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [python](https://www.python.org). In our excercises, we will be running python code and relying heavily on a suite of python packages designed for data analysis. This tutorial introduces you to the basis of python, and the most important features of these packages.\n",

    "#### How Jupyter works\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook App is a client that allows you to edit and run your notebooks via a web browser by passing commands and results to/from a server. If the server is hosted locally, the application can be executed without Internet access. Otherwise, the notebooks require internet access to a server in order to run. The two main components of this client/server system are the application dashboard (client) and an execution kernel (server). \n",
    "\n",
    "A kernel is a program that runs and introspects the userâ€™s code. The Jupyter Notebook App we will be using has a kernel for Python code, but - as noted above - there are also kernels available for many languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard of the application (which runs in a web browser) shows you the notebook documents that you have made, and  allows you to manage the kernel (restart/reset). \n",
    "\n",
    "Cells are executed using `Control-Enter`, which executes the cell that the cursor is currently in. Other options allow you to add cells and execute groups of cells. Use the `User Interface Tour` in the `Help` menu of any notebook to learn more. The keyboard icon at the far right of the menu bar also contains helpful shortcuts and a list of commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "[JupyterLab](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906) is the latest client-side interface for the Jupyter system. It builds on the Jupyter notebook model by providing an interactive development environment (IDE) for working with notebooks, code and data all in one place. In addition to having full support for Jupyter notebooks, JupyterLab enables you to use text editors, terminals, data file viewers, and other custom components side by side with notebooks in a tabbed work area. Users who have worked with MatLab, or R-Studio will find many of the features of JupyterLab similar. \n"

    "[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) is a language originally developed in the early 1990s. Relative to other languages, it is focused on readability and simplicity. Python has dynamic typing and automated memory management, making it well-suited for beginners and the rapid development of code. All of these attributes make Python ideal for scientific programming.\n",
