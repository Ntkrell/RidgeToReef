    "# Climate Variability, Food Security, and Farmer Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is an introduction to the analysis of rainfall variability, the development of stochastic models for daily rainfall in tropical drylands, and their application to understanding climate, food security, and farmer decision making. The content in this module is more than possibly be done in a single day, but it is designed to allow students from any background to work through the material at their own pace.\n",

    "The module assumes no prior experience with `python`, `pandas`, or `jupyter` notebooks. There is a substantial tutorial covering the basics of `python` that is included in `Chapter 0`, and the main module materials begin in `Chapter 1`. Where relevant, we've included links to external material that provides back\n",
