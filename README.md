## About this Repo

This repository is a set of jupyter notebooks, data, and accompanying configuration files designed to be used with the [binder](mybinder.org) system. Through Binder, these notebooks provide an executable environment, making the code immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere.

Our analyses are built on the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) python distribution, using [Python v.3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/). 

Configuration files are stored in the `binder/` folder of this repository. The `environment.yml` file contains required python packages. Note **this file cannot be auto-generated by `conda env export`.** You must instead specify the main requirements (e.g. `numpy`, `pandas`) and their versions.
