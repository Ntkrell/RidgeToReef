# RidgeToReef

Jupyter notebooks for a binder demo in the Ridge to Reef program, August 2018

Authors: Kelly Caylor (caylor@ucsb.edu) and Natasha Krell (nkrell@ucsb.edu)

## Getting Started

## About this Repo

This repository is a set of jupyter notebooks, data, and accompanying configuration files designed to be used with the [binder](mybinder.org) system. Through Binder, these notebooks provide an executable environment, making the code immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere.

Our analyses are built on the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) python distribution, using [Python v.3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/). 

### 'binder/' 

Configuration files are stored in the `binder/` folder of this repository. The `environment.yml` file contains required python packages. Note **this file cannot be auto-generated by `conda env export`.** You must instead specify the main requirements (e.g. `numpy`, `pandas`) and their versions. 

### 'data/'

The 'data/' folder contains all the necessary data files that are used in this excercise. These data were collected as part of the NSF projects acknowledged below, and any use outside of this excercise requires permission of the authors (cf. contact information above).

### 'assets/'

Any images, files, or other resources used in the notebooks are contained in the 'assets/' folder.
